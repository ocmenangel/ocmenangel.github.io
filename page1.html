    BTS 방탄소년단 is my favorite K-pop Boy Group in South Korea, they know how to dance, sing, and rap. They are talented to music and arts and they're good looking<br>
    They came to my life when the I feel down because of my family. <br>
    Because of their music and their presence they inspired me to love myself<br>
    because of them I'm happy and they tech me to it's okay to be you, no one's perfect. <br>
    They thought me to speak myself and courage myself for what I want or what I want to be <br>
    They make me happy <br>
