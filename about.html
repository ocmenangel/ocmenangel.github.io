      Did you ever lie on bed with depression, thinking “i am full of flaws”, “i hate myself”, or even “I am worthless”?<br>
      Self-love is never an easy job. When we did something below expectation, <br>
      we may sometimes fall into the anxiousness of not being good enough, judging ourselves harshly instead of appreciating ourselves for what we did.<br>

      You see everything in one go and decide for yourself what you take on your journey. <br>
      Self-love is not selfish; you cannot truly love another until you know how to love yourself.<br>
      Be proud of who you are, and not ashamed of how someone else sees you.<br>
